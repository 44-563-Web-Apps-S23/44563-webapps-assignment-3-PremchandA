<p> I came USA Jan 1st 2023 in ar india flight the flight was good and i have 15 hours of journey time and it was too hectic the food was not good in the flight, any ways it was a good experience.
    air india flight was too costly and emirates would be cheap in my opinion.  </p>

    <h3>Gulliver Travels </h3>

    <p> The gulliver travels book was my childhood favourite book and it was too interesting as a man enters into a new world and he was too big comparing to other people in that world.
        Gulliverâ€™s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads and addressed by tiny captors,
         who are in awe of him but fiercely protective of their kingdom </p>
